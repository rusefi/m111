*WORK-IN-PROGRESS* Repository to help with a better rusEFI m111 solution.

Once this project succeeds this project should be DROPPED. All forever valuable info should be stored NOT in this repo.

Andrey does NOT have any Mercedes vehicles or engines.

Andrey has Jimmy's pretty modified M111 harness for W201, set for https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/Hellen-128-Mercedes

Alex is daily driving on Hellen-128-Mercedes

Zoran has one harness remove from vehicle and removed from engine.



# Hellen128

❌ most expensive solution since a lot of case/header labor and custom PCB

❌ not water proof

❌ harness ends up being about 6 inches short to be comfortable

✔️ on board WBO

✔️ works on M104 and M112 and M113


# microRusEFI

❌usb not accessible


# Proteus
❌vertical connector meaning overall physical shape

❌dollar expensive or labor expensive ECU pigtail
















If we use OEM harness, do we cut OEM ECU connectors?

* if we cut - we have more crimping to do
* if we use random used OEM harness we are responsible for complete harness

Epoxy approach is cool but $180 labor?!
